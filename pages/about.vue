    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Northwest Sportsman, a locally produced magazine with all of our staff based here in the Northwest, details where and how to fish and hunt this great region,
    and also covers local issues and uplifting stories of sports enthusiasts throughout the region.<br/>
<br/>
We are the only locally based hunting and fishing magazine in the Northwest. All of our editors, writers and sales team are located in Washington, Oregon,<br/>
Idaho and Montana. We are published by Media Index of Seattle and are located only about 20 blocks from where Bill Farden built Fishing and Hunting News into<r/>
the premier hook-and-bullet publication from the 1960s-2000s. After F and H went out of business in late July 2008, several former salesmen and an editor were hired<br/>
by Media Index to do something similar.<br/>
<br/>
In our online edition, we spotlight interesting daily stories, breaking news, game scoflaws and more. To contact us, call 206-382-9220 or<br/>
email awalgamott@media-inc.com. Thanks!</p>
